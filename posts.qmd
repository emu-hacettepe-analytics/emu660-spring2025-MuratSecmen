*"I'm excited to share my first blog post as part of my coursework. I'm genuinely delighted to be taking this course, as it provides me with a valuable opportunity to further develop myself professionally. Throughout this journey, I aim to deepen my understanding of Operations Research (OR) methodologies and techniques, particularly focusing on Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) and their various variants. Drawing from my prior experience working with logistics firms, I look forward to synthesizing this practical knowledge with academic insights to generate original and impactful solutions. My goal is to regularly share insightful content focused on OR approaches, optimization strategies, and practical applications. I believe that gaining new knowledge in this area and actively contributing to this platform will be both rewarding and beneficial. I look forward to continuously sharing more enriching content here in the future." - March 12, 2025*
